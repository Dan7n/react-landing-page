## React landing page -  Grafiska verktyg homework

Homework assignment to learn about design, animations, branding, and brand identity. The assignment is to create something fun that mimics the design aesthetics of a brand we like.

I chose Dropbox's blog as my inspiration, and I chose to do the project in React as I'm teaching myself how to use it.
